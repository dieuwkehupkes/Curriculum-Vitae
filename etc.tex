\section{ET CETERA}

In my free time, I am a competitive pole dancer. 
I participated twice in the natural championships in the category doubles, placing 1st and 2nd in 2017 and 2018, respectively. 
In 2018, we also participated in the World Championship and arrived at place 10 of the world ranking. 
You can find our performances on youtube, or -- partly -- on \href{https://instagram.com/duo_polenotti}{\textcolor{blue}{our instagram page}}. Since 2018, I participated only in solo competitions.
