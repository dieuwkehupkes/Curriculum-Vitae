\section{Teaching Statement} 

%TODO ref to teaching experience doc

While I am still at a junior stage of my career, I have been involved already in many different types of teaching activities.
Since I was a graduate student, I have been a teaching assistant for several different courses in both bachelor and master's programmes.
In these assistant jobs, I had different types of responsibilities, including supervising computer labs, designing exercises and exams, giving guest lectures and leading discussion groups.
A few years back, when my PhD advisor dr. Zuidema had to step back for a few weeks, I took over his masters course \emph{Foundations of neural and cognitive modelling}.\\

More recently, I have taken on many supervision duties. 
I supervised 14 thesis projects of students of the master Artificial Intelligence, several group projects for the same master and I am also co-advising a PhD student supervised by dr.\ Bruni.
These projects, in which I learned much from my cosupervisors (in particular dr. Zuidema and dr. Bruni), have taught me how to motivate and guide students and how to make them work together in a team.\\

In the coming semester, I will be in charge of two bachelor courses. 
I will coordinate the course Human(e) AI, consisting of a series of guest lectures; and I will be the main lecturer of the course \emph{Taaltheorie\&Taalverwerking} (Language theory and language processing), an important course in the bachelor AI at the university of Amsterdam, with almost 200 students.
In this semester, I will also follow the University Teaching Qualification programme (\textbf{bko}), to obtain the teaching certification compulsory for all senior lecturers at Dutch Universities.

In a time where many large companies offer high-paid research positions, teaching and interaction with students are one of the reasons that I prefer working in academia.
I am looking forward to teaching more, developing my own courses and learning more from more experienced colleagues.
